# TicTacToe

To run the program from the terminal the user will run tictactoe.py from the command line. 
The user responds whether they want to play against a computer player or if the game will be two-player from the terminal.

Once the game starts, each player will take turns and be prompted to enter a desired entry from a valid list of available locations for the board.

The object of the game is to get three of a player's piece in a row on the board. The first player to get three pieces in a row wins the game.
